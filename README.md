# home-page
Project15 in The Odin Project

This is a personal portfolio homepage created primarily as a learning project to explore **responsive design**, **semantic HTML**, and **accessibility** using only HTML and CSS.

## What I learned:
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Implemented using `@media` queries
  - Ensured image responsiveness across different screen sizes
  - Used `grid minmax()` for flexible layouts
- **Semantic HTML:**
  - Properly structured the page using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and other meaningful tags for better accessibility and SEO
- **Accessibility:**
  - Understood how accessibility benefits not only people with disabilities but also in unexpected circumstances 
  - Used proper contrast ratios and keyboard-friendly navigation
  - Implemented `alt` attributes for images where necessary (ARIA landmarks weren't really necessary here)
- **CSS Techniques:**
  - Used CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a scalable and adaptable layout
  - Applied best practices for maintaining a clean and readable CSS structure

## Features:
- Showcases my projects and ways to contact me
- Fully responsive layout across different devices
- Well-structured, semantic, and accessible markup for better maintainability and usability

This project serves as a foundation for mastering modern web development principles.
